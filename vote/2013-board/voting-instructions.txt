TDF Board Elections 2013 Voting Token
Dear $member,

The election of The Document Foundation Board of Directors will soon
be open.

Voting will run from 2013-12-10, 00:00 CET/UTC+1 (early Tuesday) until
2013-12-17, 24:00 CET/UTC+1.

To vote, please go to
https://elections.documentfoundation.org/vote.php?election_id=5
and follow the instructions there.

A list of candidates and their reasons for running is available at
https://elections.documentfoundation.org/2013-board/candidates.html

When instructed to do so, enter the following details:

   E-mail: $email
   Vote token: $token

The election has 4 steps - first, you must identify yourself using the
voting token above. Then select your preferred candidates in order of
preference. A third step will show you your choice, and ask you to
confirm or return to the previous step. Finally, after confirming your
choice, a unique identifier will be given to you which will allow you to
verify after the election that your vote was counted correctly. To ensure
anonymity, no link will be kept between this token and your identifiers,
so please keep this token safe. Once you have voted, you will not be able
to vote again.

Thank you for your vote!

Regards,
  Cor Nouws
  Chair, The Document Foundation Membership Committee

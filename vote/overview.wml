    <h1>Elections: Overview of the Board of Directors</h1>

    <h2>The Document Foundation Overview</h2>

<p>The foundation's objective is to nurture and develop office software that is free to use by everyone. The foundation furthers
a sustainable, independent and meritocratic community which develops Free / Libre and Open Source Software based on
open standards through international collaboration.
In particular the foundation will advance the distribution of a repertoire of digital productivity and creativity tools (an
Office Suite, thus software for general office activities to create e.g. text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings,
pictures and diagrams). This software shall be made available for everyone (including companies and public authorities)
freely and without restrictions on the intellectual property in one's own files, to guarantee full participation in a digital
society</p>

    <p>

      contributions to The Document Foundation, individuals from various geographic regions, and
      representatives of other aspects of The Document Foundation. The Board is tasked with

    <h1>The Document Foundation Elections and Referenda</h1>

    <h2>Election Materials</h2>

    <p>
      The Document Foundation Membership holds its Board of
	  Directors and Membership Committee elections usually every two
      years. Any member can nominate themself to run in the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, sometimes the membership is asked to collectively
      decide on important changes, or is polled e.g. for conference
	  locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones responsible for running the then-current election
	  can always be reached at <a
      href="mailto:elections&#64;documentfoundation&#46;org">elections&#64;documentfoundation&#46;org</a>.
